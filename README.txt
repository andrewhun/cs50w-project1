 Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

"Books"

This program is my version of the second project in the CS50W course. It is a simple application with the following features:
- registering users
- logging users in and out
- allowing users to search a database of 5000 books (by the author, title or ISBN)
- showing relevant information and reviews of the selected book
- allowing users to leave reviews and ratings of their own
- connecting to Goodreads API to show further information
- returning data in a JSON format if the user reaches the "api/<isbn>" route
It is a crude program, especially appearance-wise. I spent little time with the visual representation. I relied on Bootstrap's "jumbotron" feature for the most part.
